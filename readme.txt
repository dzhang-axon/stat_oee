Follow the instructions below to access the interactive calculator: 

Navigate to https://gke.mybinder.org/
Under "GitHub repository name or URL" select "GitHub" and enter "https://github.com/dzhang-axon/stat_oee"
Press "launch"
After the binder opens, double click to open "Statistical OEE Measurement.ipynb" in the file directory on the left side of the screen.
Find the command bar located at the top of the notebook viewing window. It contains commands such as Save, Insert New, Cut, Paste, etc.
In the command bar, press "Run" (shaded triangle). Alternatively, press Shift+Enter. 
Turn your attention to the rightmost icon of the command bar. It should be a circle, representing the kernel state. Immediately after executing "Run", the circle should be shaded. Wait until the circle becomes unshaded again to confirm that the execution is complete. 
Continue down the notebook, executing each cell in sequential order. When an interactive cell is executed, interactive slide bars should appear, along with a printed statement detailing the results. Use the slide bars to set the inputs for each section, and observe how the output changes. 
Note: prolonged inactivity will cause the binder to timeout, and the connection will be lost. Navigate to https://gke.mybinder.org/ and follow the instructions again to create a new binder instance.
