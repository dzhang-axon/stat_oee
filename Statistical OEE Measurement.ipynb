The reference values are typically taken from the Systems Requirements Specification (SRS) or project charter. At nominal availability, productivity, and quality, OEE is 1 (equivalently expressed as 100%). \n\nWhen validating a system or machine for Site Acceptance Testing (SAT), the system is run for a fixed duration to obtain sample data. In theory, the sample data can be statistically analyzed to produce a confidence interval for the true OEE of the system, which can then be compared against target OEE values to determine whether the system passes SAT. In reality, while Quality and Productivity may be analyzed in this way, the sensitivity of Availability to infrequent events and its correlation to long-term, seasonal variability makes Availability extremely difficult to model statistically, especially in the context of SAT where historical data are not available. The difficulties of predicting Availability are discussed in further detail at the end of this article, but a statistical solution is not presented. \n\nWith regards to Quality and Productivity and the statistical analysis of SAT, more data provides greater confidence in SAT results, but more data requires more time and resources to collect. Thus, maximizing SAT result confidence and minimizing required SAT time are competing requirements.

Decreasing the sample standard deviation also decreases the measurement uncertainty, although this is a property of the process and is not directly controllable during the SAT setup.

For an automated process, this should be uncommon. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<b>Measuring Availability</b>\n\nAvailability is the hardest metric to measure. Availability can be understood as a time average of machine status, where the machine status takes a boolean value (\"operational/up\" or \"unoperational/down\"). Availablity can be estimated using Reliability Block Diagrams or Fault Tree Analysis, but both are highly dependent on subjective brainstorming and specific expertise, and are not strictly empirical methods. Empirical methods for forecasting these types of infrequent events is difficult in general (e.g. research on using a two-state Markov-chain to model the Clear Sky Index for solar irradiance), and impossible without abundant historical data; thus, forecasting and/or measuring of equipment availability during a SAT run of a new machine is impossible. \n\nThe impossibility of measuring availability using a SAT run can be illustrated as follows. Let us assume that failure events follow a Poisson distribution (memoryless). As a general property, if a Poisson event has a mean frequency of 1 over a given period, the probability that the event never occurs over that same period is roughly 37%. Applied to our example, if we expect the machine to fail on average once per day, and we perform a SAT run which lasts one day, then there is a 37% chance that no failure occurs during the SAT run. From the opposite perspective, if no failure occurs during the SAT run, one can conclude with at most 63% confidence that the long-term failure rate will be less than once per day. This is dramatically worse than the typical 95% confidence standard applied to general statistical inferences. If the SAT run is shorter, say 5 hours, or half a shift, then a failure-free SAT run would give at most 63% confidence that the long-term failure rate will be less than once per 5 hours; in other words, even if the system demonstrates a perfect 5-hour run, there is still at least 37% percent chance that, in the long-run, the system will fail more than once per 5 hours! \n\nFurthermore, measuring availability requires not only the measurement of failure frequency, but also of the Mean Time To Repair (MTTR). Even if the TTR of failure events is a normally distributed random variable (a na&iuml;ve assumption), a statistical sample of at least 30 failures must be observed to make a meaningful measurement. This is obviously not practical during SAT. \n\nIn conclusion, while Availability can be a significant contributor to OEE, it cannot be empirically measured during a SAT run. Therefore, alternative methods such as Fault Tree Analysis or a simple aggregate estimate must be employed to obtain a realistic result for the system's OEE. However, one must be careful about choosing Availability definitions when factoring Availability into SAT performance. Overall Availability is defined simply as downtime over total time, where downtime includes unscheduled maintenance, scheduled (preventive) maintenance, schedule loss, startup and shift changes, etc. Inherent Availability includes only downtime caused by unscheduled maintenance, and does not include downtime that is not caused directly by the system itself. When assessing a system for SAT, Inherent Availability should be the relevant parameter, but one must note that the Overall Availability observed over long-term usage of the system will necessarily be lower than the Inherent Availability, and how this impacts factory planning must be further scrutinized.
